     <h1>World of Warcraft: Cataclysm</h1>
     <p>World of Warcraft: Cataclysm (abbreviated as Cata), is the third expansion for World of Warcraft. Set primarily in a dramatically reforged Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms on the world of Azeroth, the expansion set follows the return of the evil Dragon Aspect Deathwing the Destroyer—formerly known as the ancient guardian Neltharion the Earth Warder—who causes a new Sundering as he makes his cataclysmic re-entrance into the world from Deepholm, the elemental plane of earth.</p>

     <h1>Decription</h1>
     <p>Cataclysm returns players to the two continents of Azeroth for most of their campaigning, after years away in Outland and Northrend, opening new zones such as Mount Hyjal, the sunken world of Vashj'ir, Deepholm, Uldum and the Twilight Highlands. It includes two new playable races, the worgen from the legendary kingdom of Gilneas for the Alliance, and the goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel from the isle of Kezan for the Horde. Among the many new developments in the expansion are the increase of the level cap to 85, the ability to use flying mounts in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms, the introduction of the secondary profession Archaeology, and the debut of reforging, as well as updates to player classes, new race-class combinations, and a dramatic restructuring of the world itself (with major revisions to existing content from the original release of the game).</p>

             <h3>Introduction</h3>
             <p>An ancient evil lies dormant within Deepholm, the domain of earth in the Elemental Plane.</p>
             <p>Hidden away in a secluded sanctuary, the corrupted Dragon Aspect Deathwing has waited, recovering from the wounds of his last battle against Azeroth and biding his time until he can reforge the world in molten fire.</p>
             <p>Soon, Deathwing the Destroyer will return to Azeroth, and his eruption from Deepholm will sunder the world, leaving a festering wound across the continents. <br> As the Horde and Alliance race to the epicenter of the cataclysm, the kingdoms of Azeroth will witness seismic shifts in power, the kindling of a war of the elements, and the emergence of unlikely heroes who will rise up to protect their scarred and broken world from utter devastation.</p>

                <h3>First announce</h3>
                <p>World of Warcraft: Cataclysm was officially announced on August 21, 2009 at BlizzCon 2009.</p>
                <p>The "friends & family" phase of the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm alpha began on May 3, 2010, while closed beta began June 30, 2010.</p>
                <p>Collectors' Edition content and pricing was announced on August 17, 2010,[4] while on October 4, 2010, Blizzard Entertainment officially announced the release date for the expansion: December 7, 2010, including for the first time a digital download edition at release.</p>
                <p>On October 16, 2013, the expansion was integrated into the basic World of Warcraft package, granting all subscribers automatic access to all of the content and features of the expansion at no additional cost.This expansion came in two versions: Standard Edition and Collector's Edition.</p>

                <h3>New zones</h3>
                <p>Unlike in the previous two expansions, The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King, there is no new continent/world for additional content; instead, Cataclysm returns players primarily to Azeroth itself, with seven new high-level (80-85) zones.</p>
                <p>Each of the five leveling zones features its own unique breadcrumb (introductory) quest and cutscene; afterwards, each is accessible quickly through portals in Stormwind City and Orgrimmar.</p>
                <p>Tol Barad is also available at level 85 via these portals.</p>

            <p><button class="btn"><i class="fa fa-ali"></i></button>Gilneas:Level 1-12 starting zone for the worgen. Players start in the Gilneas City subzone (1-5), eventually making their way to the larger zone (5-12) to complete the leveling process; they are then redirected to Darkshore to continue. <br>
            Unlike the Horde counterpart starter zones, Gilneas is available (in the form of the "Ruins of Gilneas") as a general, albeit unpopulated, world zone used only for a couple of phased Undead quests from Silverpine Forest.</p>

            <p><button class="btn-hord"><i class="fa fa-hord"></i></button> The Lost Isles: Level 5-12 zone for the goblins, a lush tropical island enclave off the eastern coast of Kalimdor.
